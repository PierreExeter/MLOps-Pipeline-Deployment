This project demonstrates a MLOps pipeline for deploying a machine learning model into a production-ready web application. The goal is to help an insurance company forecast patient charges using input like age, gender, BMI, number of children, and smoking status.

The solution includes: 

* A **machine learning** model trained to predict insurance charges 
* A **Flask back-end** to serve predictions 
* A **HTML / CSS front-end** for user input 
* Containerization with **Docker** 
* Cloud deployment on **Microsoft Azure** 
* A CI/CD pipeline with **Github Actions** 
* A product **documentation**
